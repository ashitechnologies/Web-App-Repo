- ### How to install?

```npm
npm install
```

---

- ### Seting up the environmental variables on local machines

1.  Creat a .env file under the root directory (Web-App-Repo/)

2.  Paste the following code in the newly created .env file and change the values.

    ```
    DATABASEURL="MongoDB connection string"

    SECRET="Debbie is my first open source app"

    PORT="3000"

    EMAIL="johndoe@gmail.com"

    TWOFACT="password Or 2-factor secret string"
    ```

3.  `DATABASEURL` is the connection string provided by the MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas. **_I think @gsw-codes has a common string for all of the projects._**

4.  `SECRET` can be any string or even dummy text.

5.  `PORT` is the port number for example `3000` or `8080`.

6.  `EMAIL`, this variable is the admin or the debbie email. This email will use to send mails to users when they try to change or reset their password.

7.  `TWOFACT`, this is the secret string provided by Gmail or your mail provider. I have to use this because I use 2-factor authentication for my Google account. If the admin or debbie email has no 2-fact, then you have to add your Google password instead.

> If your account has no 2FA, then go to [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and allow your app to use your Gmail service. This option won't be available for 2FA accounts

> If you have a 2FA account, then go to [Google](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords) and generate a secret string for your project.

> In Heroku, you can add env variables on the project dashboard, then _setting_ tab, then _Reveal Config Vars_ button and you can add there.
